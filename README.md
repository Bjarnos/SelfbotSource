# Chat Selfbot
### ✅ Lightweight & Easy to Use

[Chat](https://chat.jonazwetsloot.nl/) is a social media platform created by Jona Zwetsloot as a hobby project giving a fun experience—especially for Dutch users, though it's open to everyone.

While Chat currently does not support official bots, and its public API is limited to 1000 requests per day (and can be difficult to work with), this Python library offers an alternative. It interfaces with Chat through the same methods a regular user would—using the same web API available through a browser—making it much more flexible and developer-friendly.

### ✅ This Package Follows the TOS
### ✅ This Package Follows Official Rate Limits
### ✅ This Package Does NOT Access Unauthorized Endpoints

This library **does not break Chat’s Terms of Service** in any way.  
It was developed in **direct cooperation with Chat’s creator and owner, Jona Zwetsloot**, who knows of the project and supports the initiative.

Unlike unauthorized tools, this selfbot:
- Uses standard user endpoints
- Does not abuse rate limits
- Fully respects Chat’s platform integrity

If you’re a developer who wants to build cool stuff with Chat but found the official API too limiting—this library is for you.
